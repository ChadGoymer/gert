## Installation

To install the development version:

``` r
remotes::install_github("r-lib/gert")
```

On Linux you need somewhat recent version of libgit2:

 - Debian: [libgit2-dev](https://packages.debian.org/buster/libgit2-dev)
 - Fedora: [libgit2-devel](https://apps.fedoraproject.org/packages/libgit2-devel)
 
For Ubuntu Trusty and Xenial, you can use libgit2 backports from [this ppa](https://launchpad.net/~cran/+archive/ubuntu/libgit2):

```sh
sudo add-apt-repository ppa:cran/libgit2
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install libgit2-dev
```
 
It is still possible to install the package with older versions of libgit2 (e.g. on CentOS) however these do not support authentication over ssh/https remotes. Offline functionality should work fine.

## Example

This is a basic example:

``` r
library(gert)
path <- file.path(tempdir(), "ggplot2")
repo <- git_clone("https://github.com/hadley/ggplot2", path)
print(repo)
```
